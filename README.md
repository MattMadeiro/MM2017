# MM2017
![The pseudo-desktop design of MattMadeiro.com.](/mm2017.jpg?raw=true)

I cut my teeth on Geocities. Early websites were weird, loud, and dense, shocks of color so dang *sincere* that I still feel charmed long after they ceased to exist. My own page meddled in the world of Pok√©mon cheat codes. (That probably says all you need to know about me.) The 2016-2017 edition of [mattmadeiro.com](http://mattmadeiro.com) is a throwback to those days of wonder, when the World Wide Web felt very personal, very intimate, and still small enough to understand.

## Goals

- Finally see what this React thing was all about
- Experiment with modular CSS, as espoused by Tachyons
- Create a rich and fully responsive website that loads in less than a second for most connections

Design-wise, I wanted to capture the strongest and most nostalgic visual language I know: early operating systems. My first computer was a Windows 95 machine that creaked enormously as it booted up. The design of MM2017 features strong borders, simple icons, and a familiar header bar for each of the 'apps' that you can interact with, all overlaid with more modern flourishes. The entire site functions like the operating systems you know: clicking an icon will open up a new program in a small window on the 'desktop', which can then be dragged freely around the screen. Novelty is a remarkable thing.

## Challenges

I built the first version of the site between August and September of 2017, with final release in early October. It's not inaccurate to say my brain broke a few times along the way. Having fiddled with React and then Riot.js for the site's framework, I set myself the task of designing the entire experience to be responsive. This is a breeze (I know now) with frameworks like Tachyons, but the bigger obstacle was mental. I wanted the site's individual 'apps' to be sprawling, intricate things, with a wide variety of interfaces, but I realized early on that my own ambition wouldn't produce a site that still worked perfectly on the narrow viewport of a mobile phone.

When I realized this, my focus shifted. Instead of stuffing each app like a junk drawer, I stripped each one down to the core of its purpose. I still needed a few design revisions to land there, but each app now conveys its own message in a simple, fluid way, and I'm positive they're better for it. Old operating systems were notoriously tricky to navigate, but I'm pleased to say that madeirOS is the opposite.
