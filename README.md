# MM2017
![The pseudo-desktop design of MattMadeiro.com.](/mm2017.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

I cut my teeth on Geocities. Early websites were weird and dense, shocks of color so dang *sincere* that I still feel charmed when I remember they exist. My own page meddled in the world of Pok√©mon cheat codes. (That probably says enough.) The 2016-2017 edition of [mattmadeiro.com](http://mattmadeiro.com) is a throwback to those days of wonder, when the World Wide Web felt very personal, very intimate, and still small enough to understand.

## Goals

- Finally see what this *React* thing was all about
- Experiment with modular CSS, as espoused by Tachyons
- Create a rich and fully responsive website that loads in less than a second for most connections

Design-wise, I wanted to capture the strongest and most nostalgic visual language I know: early operating systems, stretching back to my first computer, a Windows 95 machine. The design of MM2017 features strong borders, simple icons, and a familiar header bar for each of the 'apps' that you can interact with, all overlaid with more modern touches. The entire site functions like the operating systems of old: clicking an icon will open up a new program in a small window on the 'desktop', which can then be dragged freely around the screen. Novelty is a remarkable thing.
